//! Stack overflow handling
//!
//! The CLR treats a stack overflow as unrecoverable: it terminates the process without running another line of managed
//! code, so a managed crash report for that run can never happen on its own. The handler installed here is reached
//! through the vectored exception path, which runs ahead of the runtime's own handling, and the pages Windows keeps in
//! reserve are enough to write a report and, when the managed side registered one, to hand the overflow to a fresh
//! thread that still has a stack.
